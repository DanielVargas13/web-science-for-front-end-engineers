Computer Science for Front End Developers
=======

Within the past decade, the role of Web Developers have drastically changed. Specifically the distinction between both Front End Developers who focus on the client-side (browser-based) aspects of web software, and Back End Developers who focus on server side aspects has created a notable separation in the industry. 

As a Front End Developer, I believe that it is increasingly apparent that our profession is sometimes regarded as one of the easier roles in the broad spectrum of professional software development. To be honest, I agree that within the scope of the various complexities of web-based software, Front End Development does have aspects which are 'easier'. However the industry is changing and so is software. The overall quality and complexity of user interfaces is far more complex than ever before; in addition, the technical ability and craftsmanship needed to architect such interfaces is far less sympathetic to entry level professionals. 

With this in mind, 'Computer Science for Front End Developers' is an attempt to explore practical uses of contemporary computer science, and to directly apply such into Front End Development. The book involves topics such as the History of the Web and its architecture. However feel free to skip to the sections which are most relevant to you, I hope that they are of help in your professional development.
