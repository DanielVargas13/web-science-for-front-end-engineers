### History of web browsers

#### 1990 - 1995

According to Tim Berners-Lee, the world's first web browser was created in 1990 and was named 'WorldWideWeb'. This name was rather ambiguous and as a result was renamed 'Nexus' to distinct itself from the Internet itself. Tim developed Nexus using the NeXT operating system \(a major component of Apple's future operating systems\).
