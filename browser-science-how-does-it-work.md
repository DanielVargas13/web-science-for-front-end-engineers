### History of web browsers

#### 1990 - 1995

> Back-end Engineers are experts on servers, Hardware Engineers are experts in microprocessors and because Front-End Engineers built applications in the browser, they should be browser experts. As the browser continues to evolve in complexity, this idea will become more apparent.

##### WorldWideWeb/Nexus

According to Tim Berners-Lee, the world's first web browser was created in 1990 and was named 'WorldWideWeb'. This name was rather ambiguous and as a result was renamed 'Nexus' to distinct itself from the network known as the Internet. Tim developed Nexus using the NeXT operating system \(a major component of Apple's future operating systems\). He noted that NeXT enabled him to develop the browser rapidly due to its WYSIWYG editor and classes which he extended \[3\]. Interestingly it was written in Objective-C, the dominant language of iOS development until Swift.
