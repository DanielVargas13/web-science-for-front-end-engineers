# A conceptual overview of the web

According to w3.org, the initial purposes of the web was to share academic journals between researchers in a remote fashion. In other words, the web was built to enable information to be shared between people independent of their geographical location. Tim Berners-Lee developed a protocol to handle this use case; this protocol was called HTTP. This enabled two remote computers to connect with each other via the underlying technologies which power HTTP, namely TCP and IP. TCP \(Transmission Control Protocol\) handled the actual transmission of data between computers and IP \(Internet Protocol\) provided a distinct address which the data could be sent. Subsequently the Internet has been used in a variety of contexts which differ starkly from its original use. Web applications are now built for Ecommerce, education, banking and a whole host of other such application areas. As a result of this, we are here today, in 2017 in which web applications have become perhaps the most popular form of software, with cloud services, intelligent autonomous systems and even large scale geocomputational systems such as Google Maps being written for use in the browser.
